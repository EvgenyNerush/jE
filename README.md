This code implements:

  * Metropolis algorithm
  * Baier-Katkov general formula for the photon emission by charged particles with spin 1/2. The
    refractive index, radiation recoil and spin flips can be taken into account
  * Formulas for fast computation of synchrotron-Cherenkov radiation
  * A number of tests
